File Upload Platform Project
Project Overview
This project aims to build a simple platform for uploading and viewing files. It incorporates user authentication, file management, and image processing using various technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, and more.

Features
User Authentication: Implement token-based authentication for secure access.
File Management:
List all uploaded files.
Upload new files.
Change permissions of existing files.
View specific files.
Generate thumbnails for image files.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express: Web framework for Node.js to build the API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing file metadata.
Redis: In-memory data store for temporary data and caching.
Bull: Library for setting up background job processing.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
Sharp: Library for image processing to generate thumbnails.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Create an API with Express.
Authenticate users effectively.
Store and manage data in MongoDB.
Utilize Redis for temporary data storage.
Set up and use background workers for processing tasks.
